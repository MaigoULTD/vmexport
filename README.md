# vmexport
A simple Batch CLI script that will export your VMWare VMs to OVF. 
--------------
Directions
--------------

Download or clone, then run vmexport.bat. Input your directories, and wait for the process to finish.

-------------
Notes:
-------------

The script will *not* work if there is an ISO mounted to an optical drive and the ISO is missing (as in there's a path to an ISO that is non-existent), as the OVFTool won't continue.
